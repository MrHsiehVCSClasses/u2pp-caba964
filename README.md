The code is a monkey factory that allows you to customize your primeape. It can change from monkey or gorilla. Then it will ask about its name, age, and penis size. If you choose a monkey it will ask you if it has a tail, and a banana. If it is a gorilla it will ask you if it has muscles or not. It will output your newly customized primeape. In order to run it you have to input a number for a gorilla or monkey.
